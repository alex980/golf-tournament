-- Thanks to Juliana Oyola for these instructions -- 
This will be a document to reference when using GIT
Two ways one can use github 
Easiest: Downloading the Github Desktop https://desktop.github.com/
Terminal

# Accessing the Repo on github on Terminal 
[♡] You are going to want to clone the current repository in 'Main' Branch
'git clone https://github.com/julsoyola/golfTournament.git' 

- Follow this if you have trouble (https://gist.github.com/ccannon94/982d69b23659d66c0ca6fb1384f94c97)

[♡] Once you cloned it you are going to want to check if you're in the right branch 
'git branch' (It should say main)

[♡] Make sure your branch is up to date
'git pull' 

[♡] Check out your branch 
git checkout <working-branch-name> (do another 'git pull'  to make sure you're up to date)

[♡] Update your personal branch from master (AKA main)
'git rebase origin'
- Trouble shoot (if you get fatal: invalid upstream 'master')
- Add the remote upstream 'git remote add upstream https://github.com/julsoyola/golfTournament.git' 
(But use your own branch HTTPS)


(If you want to check whats new use 'git status' and it will tell you what branch you are on and what files
can be commited.)

[♡] Adding a file(s) to the main branch 
Would rec using the command line or github desktop
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository
To add it in terminal you are going to do this..
[♡] 1. Check 'git status' (check what files u need to add)
[♡] 2. Add the Files you want to commit 'git add <filename' 
 -  Ex. git add gitInstructions.txt (I am adding this txt file)
    
Or 'git add -all' To add all of ur files
[♡] 3. Now commit 'git commit -m "Your message here"' 
[♡] 4. You should make sure you are on the right branch before you send 
'git branch' (it will tell u which branch u are on)

[♡] 5. Now push to main 'git push' 

Now when you look on github you can see that you made a commit
As a team we can compare and pull the request. 

This allows us from not pushing bad code and checking it before mushing it all in main. 
Then once we review it we can Merge Pull Request
